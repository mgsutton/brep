# PADT BRep
A simple C++ geometry brep structure inspired from the ANSYS BRep.  This structure holds an immutable geometry database for CAD geometry.  The actual geometry is stored in a faceted representation.  No analytic geometry (NURBS, Conics, etc...) is contained in the structure.  

The primary use of this structure for geometric queries, traversals and renderings.
